  # However

  Tests are happening, lots of tests from Chromium, some from Mozilla, and then
  some other.

  - <a href="https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central">https://treeherder.mozilla.org/#/jobs?repo=mozilla-central</a>
  - Also running on Chromium's CI

  Reasonably encouraging Web Compat results

  # Editorial

  - Now use [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) instead of [ReSpec](https://github.com/w3c/respec)
      - Faster spec loading
      - More cross-referencing capabilities
      - Algorithms validation
      - Generaly more ergonomic
  - Auto-publishing and tests via [travis-ci](https://travis-ci.org/WebAudio/web-audio-api)
  - [Diff](https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/1737/c05ff33...rtoy:10a9cfb.html#Convolution-channel-configurations) and [preview](https://pr-preview.s3.amazonaws.com/rtoy/web-audio-api/pull/1737.html) in PRs
  - [Changelog](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#changelog) (required for CR)
  - [IPR validation](https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/pr/id/WebAudio/web-audio-api/1758) for any non-trivial PR (automatic)

  # Fixes taxonomy

  In order of frequency:

  - CR process compliance
  - Features
  - Bug fixes
  - Specification holes

  ---

  # AudioWorklet changes

  - ... numerous
  - Output arrays are zero-initialized
  - `outputChannel` now works in the ctor (mono by default)
  - Flexible channel topologies (`n` inputs of `m` channels).
  - `AudioParam` `ArrayBuffer` with constant value during this render quantum
     _can_ have a length of 1
  - Return value (allows implementing tails)
  - `processorOptions` dictionary
  - `currentFrame` in Worklet Global Scope
  - Normative text for event loop integration

  ---

  # OfflineAudioContext lazy allocation

  - The allocation is only done when `startRendering()` is called
  - A failure to allocate is signaled by a rejected `Promise`

  ---

  # MediaElementAudio SourceNode behaviour

  - Once "captured", can't undo it
  - On `AudioContext.{close, suspend}`, audio frames are dropped (not auto
  paused/no auto routed to the speakers again)
  - `HTMLMediaElement.captureStream()` exists, is more flexible

  ---

  # PannerNode .set{Orientation,Position} and ctor can now throw

  - (Reminder) Equivalent to:

  ```
  {PannerNode,AudioListener}.{position,orientation}.{X,Y,Z}.value = v;
  ```

  - Throws is if a `setValueCurveAtTime` event exists at `currentTime`
  - The ctor checks for values outside valid values, and can now throw
  - `refDistance` can now be 0

  ---

  # Cycles with AudioParam, AudioListener

  - `AudioParam` have a transitive precedence relation with their `AudioNode`
  - `AudioListener` is an implicit input of all the `PannerNode`s
  - This allows the quasi-topological sort to yield the correct order, and to
  have minimal delay in cycles

  ---

  # AnalyserNode memory footprint

  - Changing `fftSize` should not introduce discontinuities
  - This means that the node should always keep 32768 sample-frames
  around for each `AnalyserNode`.


  ---

  # AudioContextOptions

  - Can specify settings like so:

  ```js

  var ac = new AudioContext({ latencyHint: "playback",
                              sampleRate: 16000 });

  ```

  - By default
      - `"interactive"` (low-latency) audio output
      - sample-rate rate of the default audio output device sample-rate
      - beware of 192kHz sound card, üí∏üí∏üí∏.

  ---

  # AudioBufferSourceNode precise definition

  Very precisely specced now

  - [Looping](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#looping-AudioBufferSourceNode)
  - [Playback](https://webaudio.github.io/web-audio-api/#playback-AudioBufferSourceNode)

  Start and stop are subsample-accurate, looping as well. Specced with an
  algorithm (more precise than english), with lots of (non-normative) diagrams
  to explain.

  ---

  # AudioParam rates

  - `AudioParam.automationRate` : `a-rate` | `k-rate`
  - A few restrictions
      - `AudioBufferSourceNode.{playbackRate,detune}`, always `"k-rate"`
      - `DynamicsCompressorNode.{threshold, knee, ratio, attack, release}`, always `"k-rate"`
      - `PannerNode`, `AudioListener` `AudioParam`s, always `"k-rate"` if HRTF,
      selectable otherwise.
      - `BiquadFilterNode` params are now `a-rate` (allows audio rate modulation
      of filter cutoff, etc.)
      - `k-rate` often _much_ cheaper in terms of CPU

  ---

  # AudioBuffer clarifications

  - `new AudioBuffer` can throw: OOM (by policy or because of hardware
     constraints)
  - `copyFromChannel` and `copyToChannel` can throw as well

  ---

  # OscillatorNode detune nominal range

  Reminder: silent clipping of `AudioParam`s to nominal range _during
  processing_.

  Now:

  ¬±1200 √ó log<sub>2</sub>(FLT_MAX) ‚âÖ ¬±153600

  This prevents overflows and NaNs, etc.

  ---

  # Closed BaseAudioContext

  Does not throw error anymore. In fact nothing throws when a context is
  closed, things just don't happen.

  ---

  # Suspend/resume early return

  - Now the promise is going to do the full round-trip every time
  - Makes reasonning about it much simpler

  ---

  # AudioParam insertion rules

  In a few words:

  - It's allowed to schedule a ramp that ends on a curve.
  - It's allowed to schedule something exactly at the end of the curve
  - It's not allowed to schedule something that starts or end in a curve
  - We're trying to make it so that time are _not_ clamped w.r.t `currentTime`

  ---

  # The big garbage collection observability issue

  - Consequence of the fact that an `AudioWorklet` is "_in_" the graph itself
  - Garbage collection observability via the number of channels, possibly transitively through
  multiple nodes
  - Fixed via making the channel count tied to deterministic events in the
  lifetime of the `AudioNode`s

  ---

  # Tail time vs. channels

  - Specify the intuitive behaviour
  - Channel changes now occur after the tail time
  - The goal is for channel changes to not be observable, but to allow
  optimizations
  - Take into account `channelIntepretation`, `channelCountMode`.

  ---

  # Security and privacy consideration section

  Required for CR

  Analysis of various fingerprinting vectors:

  - Hardware characteristics: max channel count, sample-rate (can be spoofed)
  - Clock skew between system time and audio time
  - Latency figures, depends on the hardware and software
  - Ultrasonic communication channel
  - System sound masquerading

  ---

  # Web Audio API is now a W3C Candidate Recommendation

  - üçæüçª
  - The text specifies a coherent set of features, with multiple interoperable
  implementations
  - Loooong process
  - Has been reviewed by various groups and with different perspectives (TAG,
  Security & privacy review)
  - A few issues in the CR text, please still refer to the Editor's Draft
  - New charter, largely similar

  ---

  # V.NEXT

  - Gates are officially opened for new ideas and features
  - We (the AudioWG) have labeled existing issues, and assigned initial
  priorities
      - [High priority V2](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22High+Priority+V2%22)

      - [V1 enhancements](https://github.com/WebAudio/web-audio-api/labels/Theme%20-%20V1%20Enhancement)

  # My (personal) view on the matter

  - Audio output device decoupling
  - Symmetrical synchronous and asynchronous audio/video encoding/decoding API,
    based on [WhatWG Streams](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org/)
  - Tight WASM integration (B.Y.O.B. API)
  - CPU flags management (`DAZ`/`FTZ`) for WASM
  - `AudioContext` in Web Worker
  - In memory audio buffer compression

  # Help wanted

  - (Please please please) think very hard about what you need
  - (Please please please) write prototypes
  - (Please please please) don't open issues on things that are already possible
